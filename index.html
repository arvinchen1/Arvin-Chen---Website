        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-Businessüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, my name is Arvin Chen and I am currently a Pre-Business major at the University of California Riverside, in which I plan to enter the School of Business with an emphasis on Accounting & Auditing. <br><br>
In high school, I was an athlete, participating in Track & Field as a varsity hurdler, though running was not my strong suit. I loved doing my event no matter how difficult the practice and workouts were, and I enjoyed the experiences along the way, even if I was never able to win a race. I feel the experiences gained were far more valuable than any medal could provide.<br><br>
	In my personal life, I used to be an avid video game player, spending thousands of hours on each individual game, working hard to achieve my goals in any way possible no matter how tedious. I think during my adolescence, I had much more time to focus on video games rather than schoolwork, but somehow through my perseverance, I was able to distribute my time evenly and focus on the things I wanted while maintaining proper grades.<br><br>
My previous job experience includes an internship at IQ Laser Vision, in which I worked as a student intern, consolidating patient records, and organizing previous patient charts in storage. I would also be taught how to analyze their daily transactions and analyze their receipts. During this job I would work almost daily, not entirely interacting with the customers, but more with office work. <br><br>
	In addition, I have worked in a restaurant setting, waiting tables and working as a cashier. Even though the pay was not that good and the labor was intensive, I very much enjoyed the job for the fact that I would be able to work in such an exciting environment, being able to move around all day. To me working as a waiter was a very important experience, teaching me customer service skills, but more importantly, it was my first occupation to receive compensation. 
	Personally, I very much enjoyed my previous jobs, where I gained experience in an office setting and at an outside setting, being able to see the benefits of both jobs. Working in an office has the comforts of sitting, and the ability to focus more precisely on work, while working in a restaurant setting allowed me to enjoy expending my energy, and putting smiles on peoples‚Äô faces. <br><br>
	The reason I want to pursue an accounting career is due to a teacher I had in high school, who mainly taught accounting, but also coached me in Track & Field. He was a huge inspiration for my life, acting not as a teacher or coach but more as a mentor and role model. He always said he was ‚Äúthe wealthiest man alive,‚Äù not monetarily, but because of the value of his happiness, and to me those words could never ring truer. Doing what I would enjoy for the rest of my life has more value to me than doing things purely for monetary gain.<br><br>
	As of now, I am completing my undergraduate degree, working hard to maintain my GPA so I can be accepted into the School of Business at the University of California - Riverside.
